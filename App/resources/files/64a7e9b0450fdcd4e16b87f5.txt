The Czech Republic will provide Ukraine with combat helicopters and assist Kyiv with the training of F-16 fighter jet pilots, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said Friday.

“The Czech Republic will help with the training of pilots including pilots for F-16 and we will supply Ukraine with F-16 flight simulators so that the training can happen not just in the West but in Ukraine as well,” Fiala said speaking at a joint news conference with Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky in Prague.

Fiala also said the Czech Republic have already sent 676 pieces of heavy equipment and over 4 million pieces of medium and large calibre ammunition to Ukraine.

“This means that every day, since the first day of the war, about 10,000 pieces of ammunition and at least one tank, rocket launcher, howitzer and so on have been leaving the Czech Republic for Ukraine,” he said.

When asked about Russia’s frozen assets in the West, Fiala said the Czech Republic and European allies were discussing ways in which the frozen assets could be used to help fund Ukraine’s post war reconstruction.

"This is not a simple topic, either from a legal or other points of view, but intensive negotiations are taking place precisely so that we can also use these frozen assets to help Ukraine," Fiala said.
